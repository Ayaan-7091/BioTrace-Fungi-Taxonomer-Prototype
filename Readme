# ðŸ§¬ BioTrace: Fungi Taxonomer Prototype

A prototype pipeline for **fungal sequence classification and clustering**.  
This project trains a deep learning model to classify fungal families from DNA sequences, and includes tools for clustering and visualization.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start in Google Colab

You can run this project directly in Google Colab â€” no local setup needed:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Ayaan-7091/BioTrace-Fungi-Taxonomer-Prototype/blob/main/train_model.py)

*(The badge above will open `train_model.py` in Colab. You can replace the path with any notebook or script you want to highlight.)*

## ðŸ§ª Workflow

1. **Prepare Data**  
   The dataset (`fungi_labeled_data.csv`) includes sequences and their family labels.

2. **Train Model**  
   Run `train_model.py` to train a 1D CNN classifier. The trained model will be saved as `fungi_family_classifier.h5`.

3. **Discover Clusters**  
   Use `discover_clusters.py` to perform clustering on learned embeddings and save results.

4. **Visualize**  
   Launch `dashboard.py` to explore the clusters interactively.
